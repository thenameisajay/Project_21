# Welcome to the Number Guessing Game PROJECT_21!

## How to Play:

### Objective: Your goal is to guess a special 4-digit pin every day. You'll be scored based on:

When you guess the pin during the day.
How long you take to guess.
How many tries you take to get it right.
Scoring Details:

## Time of Day Bonus:

The game starts every day at midnight (00:00).
The earlier you guess the pin in the day, the higher your bonus! For example, if you guess it at 1:00 AM, you get a bigger bonus than if you guess at 11:00 PM.
Time Taken Bonus:

The faster you guess, the more points you get.
If you take more than 30 seconds to guess, your points for this part will begin to decrease.
 ## Number of Tries Penalty:

The fewer tries you take to guess the pin, the better.
For every 10 additional tries, you'll lose some points. So, keep guessing smartly!
## Winning the Game:

Your score is the sum of the three parts above, and the highest possible score is 1,000,000.
Each day brings a new pin and a new challenge. So, come back every day to see how well you can do!

## Tips:
Start early in the day to get the biggest time-of-day bonus.
Try to guess quickly but also carefully. You want a balance of speed and accuracy.
Remember, every 10 wrong guesses will reduce your score a bit. So, think before you guess!
Good luck, and have fun guessing the pin!
